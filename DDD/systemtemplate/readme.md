In this design system .  
we have three screen type devices.  
min screen device: cellphone  
middle screen device: tablet  
large screen device: pc.  

pc and tablet screen is large than cellphone.  
we can put more information in design pages;  
cellphone only has small screen.  
we can put less information in design pages or we can use one componet do more things;  

In pc and tablet screen we can put the lable in page;  
such as accout name label,password lable etc.  
and we put the text box after those labels.  
use can input letter into the textbox.  

but in cellphone screen it's to small.  
design 1 exist label:  
label in a row.text box in another row.  

design 2 not exist lable:  
we put the place holder in text box componet.  
in the case the text box has two function.  
1 show tip information like please input account name.  
2 input the letter into textbox  

I don't know which design you love best ;  
but in one system .we must uniform format.  
whole system use design 1 or use 2.  

First I will design the pc pages.
